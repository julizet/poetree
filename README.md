# poetree
PoeTree is a tiny prototype that gives city trees a face and a voice using generative AI. It tells their story in an emotional and rather entertaining way to raise awareness about city trees as a crucial part of the city's infrastructure. For the image, we currently use DALL-E (OpenAI), and for the poem, we use ChatGPT (OpenAI).

### Further imporvements could be made:
- use Dalle-E API to **auto-generate** image based of some trees characteristica e.g. type of tree, age of tree, height of tree etc.
- use the ChatGPT to auto-generate the poem based of some trees characteristica
- add some more helpful information about the tree
- add further tree personas

### TBD
